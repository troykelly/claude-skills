If CI is still running or has failures, you should NOT stop until CI is green or failures are documented.\n\n2. **Review Artifact**: If source code was modified, was comprehensive-review completed and artifact posted to the issue? Check the issue for a comment containing `<!-- REVIEW:START -->`.\n\n3. **Unaddressed Findings**: Are there any unaddressed review findings? The review artifact should show `Unaddressed: 0`.\n\n4. **PR-Issue Link**: If a PR was created, does the issue have a COMPLETE review artifact?\n\nIf CI is incomplete, respond: 'CI is still running for PR #X. I should wait for CI to complete before stopping.'\n\nIf any review requirements are incomplete, inform the user what needs to be done before stopping."
